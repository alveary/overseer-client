# overseer-client

golang implementation for adding services to the overseer registry. It just connects to the overseer via REST resources, 
so feel free to implement your own connection to the overseer service. 

## TODOs:

- fix announcement of services
- allow announcement of multiple entry points
- allow asking for multiple services at once
- add README content ;)
